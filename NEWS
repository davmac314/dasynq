Dasynq version 1.2.1:
--------------------

This version fixes a bug which triggered when an event loop was constructed with delayed initialisation and
then never initialised before being destroyed. On systems using POSIX timers (such as FreeBSD), this could
cause a crash.

On Linux, eventfd is used as the mechanism to signal an event loop in another thread, rather than a pipe.
This uses one less file descriptor and is more efficient generally.

Some minor packaging issues have been resolved.


Dasynq version 1.2.0:
--------------------

This version includes important bugfixes, including cases where the wrong
exception type was thrown for certain errors with some event loop backends.
Additionally, it fixes compilation issues with newer compilers.

New feature: delayed event loop initialisation.

  An event loop can be constructed via a noexcept constructor and initialised
later via an init() function. See the documentation for details.


Dasynq version 1.1.7:
--------------------

This version includes several minor bugfixes, including for a memory leak.

A simple chat server example has been added (in the examples/ folder).


Dasynq Version 1.1.6:
--------------------

This version includes a critical bug-fix for the itimer-based timer
implementation (affecting OpenBSD, but not most other systems).

The documentation has also been slightly updated and re-styled.
