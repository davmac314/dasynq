Dasynq version 2.1.4:
--------------------

Hot on the heels of 2.1.3, this version has a build fix for the kqueue-based event loop, affecting
several BSD platforms.


Dasynq version 2.1.3:
--------------------

The only user-visible change in this version is that the meson build properly generates the
dasynq.pc file again, fixing an issue where the build silently produced a broken file.
There are also some internal cleanups.


Dasynq version 2.1.2:
--------------------

This version includes a single build configuration fix. If DASYNQ_HAVE_EVENTFD was defined as 0,
the build would include support for eventfd as if DASYNQ_HAVE_EVENTFD was instead defined as 1.
The meson.build file has been updated to install headers to the correct 'includedir' location.


Dasynq version 2.1.1:
--------------------

This version includes a minor error-handling bugfix and recognises NetBSD as a platform with
kqueue support (as well as including a suitable Makefile for NetBSD).


Dasynq version 2.1.0:
--------------------

This version includes bugfixes and a minor new feature: the ability to retrieve the "si_code" and
"si_status" values associated with a child process termination (proc_status_t) directly.

Fixes include some compilation issues, and a hang fix for macOS (due to POSIX non-conformance),
possibly also affecting some other systems.


Dasynq version 2.0.0:
--------------------

This major new release introduces a small backwards incompatibility. Child watchers now receive information
about child status via a wrapper type (proc_status_t). On systems which support it (eg. FreeBSD) the full
integer exit value is available, rather than just the lower 8 bits.

This version also includes compilation fixes and (theoretical) bug fixes for the pselect/select backends.


Dasynq version 1.2.5:
--------------------

This version includes a compilation fix for the child_proc_watch::send_signal function.


Dasynq version 1.2.4:
--------------------

This version includes a fix for some minor issues that may manifest after memory is full (i.e. rarely).
It also includes a fix for using file (output) watchers (in emulation mode) with the /dev/null device on
FreeBSD (this returns an undocumented error code, which was not previously handled by Dasynq).


Dasynq version 1.2.3:
--------------------

This version includes a fix in the epoll backend for incorrectly reporting IN_EVENTS or OUT_EVENTS on file
descriptor watches for which the respective event type had been disabled, in case of an error condition of
the descriptor.


Dasynq version 1.2.2:
--------------------

This version includes a fix for a crash/memory leak that could happen when memory was (already) exhausted.

It also uses a new directory structure. This should not affect any existing users. However it is now
possible to install Dasynq so the main header, dasynq.h, can be included without requiring any additional
compiler flags (i.e. by installing it directly in /usr/include). The ancillary headers are now installed
into a subdirectory relative to the main header.


Dasynq version 1.2.1:
--------------------

This version fixes a bug which triggered when an event loop was constructed with delayed initialisation and
then never initialised before being destroyed. On systems using POSIX timers (such as FreeBSD), this could
cause a crash.

On Linux, eventfd is used as the mechanism to signal an event loop in another thread, rather than a pipe.
This uses one less file descriptor and is more efficient generally.

Some minor packaging issues have been resolved.


Dasynq version 1.2.0:
--------------------

This version includes important bugfixes, including cases where the wrong
exception type was thrown for certain errors with some event loop backends.
Additionally, it fixes compilation issues with newer compilers.

New feature: delayed event loop initialisation.

  An event loop can be constructed via a noexcept constructor and initialised
later via an init() function. See the documentation for details.


Dasynq version 1.1.7:
--------------------

This version includes several minor bugfixes, including for a memory leak.

A simple chat server example has been added (in the examples/ folder).


Dasynq Version 1.1.6:
--------------------

This version includes a critical bug-fix for the itimer-based timer
implementation (affecting OpenBSD, but not most other systems).

The documentation has also been slightly updated and re-styled.
