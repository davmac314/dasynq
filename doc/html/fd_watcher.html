<h2>fd_watcher</h2>

<p><b>Brief</b>: <i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i> is a member type of the <a href="event_loop.html"><i class="code-name">event_loop</i></a>
template class. It represents an event watcher for file-descriptor readiness events; a registered
<i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i> will receive callbacks when its associated file descriptor is
ready for reading or writing (or both, if supported by the event loop back-end). The
<i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i> class should not be subclassed directly; the
<a href="#fd_watcher_impl"><i class="code-name">fd_watcher_impl</i></a> template provides a means for subclassing.</p>

<h2>Members</h2>

<div class="small-indent">

<h3>Types</h3>
<ul>
<li><i class="code-name">event_loop_t</i> &mdash; the event loop type that this watcher registers with.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Constructors</h3>
<ul>
<li><i class="code-name">fd_watcher()</i> &mdash; default constructor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Functions</h3>
<ul>
<li>(#1) <i class="code-name">void add_watch(event_loop_t &eloop, int fd, int flags, bool enabled = true, int prio = DEFAULT_PRIORITY)</i>
    <br>&mdash; register a watcher with an event loop. <i class="code-name">flags</i> is a combination of <i class="code-name">dasynq::IN_EVENTS</i> and
    <i class="code-name">dasynq::OUT_EVENTS</i> (see details section for limitations). May throw
    <i class="code-name">std::bad_alloc</i> or <i class="code-name">std::system_error</i>.</li>
<li>(#2) <i class="code-name">template &lt;typename T&gt;
    <br>static fd_watcher *add_watch(event_loop_t &eloop, int fd, int flags, T watchHndlr)</i>
    <br>&mdash; add a dynamically-allocated watch with the specified callback. The watch is automatically
    deleted when removed. See <a href="#add_watch_2">details</a> below.</li>
<li><i class="code-name">void add_watch_noemu(event_loop_t &eloop, int fd, int flags, bool enabled = true, int prio = DEFAULT_PRIORITY)</i>
    <br>&mdash; add a watcher with no emulation. See <i class="code-name">add_watch</i>(#1). If the backend
    does not support the specified file descriptor, throws <i class="code-name">std::system_error</i> rather
    than emulating readiness events (see details section).</li>
<li><i class="code-name">void deregister(event_loop_t &eloop) noexcept</i>
    <br>&mdash; request removal from the event loop.</li>
<li><i class="code-name">int get_watched_fd()</i> &mdash; returns the file descriptor associated with this watcher.</li>
<li><i class="code-name">void set_enabled(event_loop_t &eloop, bool enable) noexcept</i> &mdash; enable or disable the watcher.</li>
<li><i class="code-name">virtual void watch_removed() noexcept</i> &mdash; called when the watcher has been
    removed from the event loop.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Protected functions</h2>

<ul>
<li><i class="code-name">void set_watch_flags(int newFlags)</i> &mdash; set watched event types (a combination
of <i class="code-name">IN_EVENTS</i> and <i class="code-name">OUT_EVENTS</i>). Must only be called if
the event loop supports multi-direction file descriptor watches (i.e. if the
<i class="code-name">has_separate_rw_fd_watches</i> loop trait is false). For multi-threaded event loops, must only be called
from within the callback function. Takes effect when the watcher is next enabled (either by using the
<i class="code-name">set_enabled</i> function or returning the <i class="code-name">REARM</i> code from
the callback).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Details and Usage</h2>

<p><span class="note"><i>Note:</i> also see the <a href="event_loop.html#watcher-constraints">watcher constraints</a> section.</span></p>

<p>A file descriptor often represents an input or output channel (or both) for which I/O <i>readiness</i> is a
detectable event. For example, a connected network socket becomes ready for input when data is received over
the network, and ready for output when the output buffer is not full (or is below some threshold) due to
data being successfully transmitted. An <i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i> implementation receives
notification of readiness events on a file descriptor.</p>

<p>When registering an <i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i> you specify which events you are interested in
using either of the <i class="code-name">IN_EVENTS</i> and <i class="code-name">OUT_EVENTS</i>
flags. Some event loop backends support watching for both input and output readiness on the same file descriptor
using a single watcher (<i>epoll</i> style) &mdash; this is supported by specifying both flags, as
<i class="code-name">IN_EVENTS | OUT_EVENTS</i> &mdash; and others require separate watchers for input and
output (<i>kqueue</i> style). To avoid compatibility issues it is recommended to use
<i class="code-name">bidi_fd_watcher</i> rather than <i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i> in order to watch
for both input and output events on a single file descriptor.</p>

<p>Note that backends do not generally support more than one watcher on the same file descriptor (or more than
one watcher for either reading or writing). Attempting to register multiple watchers for the same file
descriptor has unspecified behaviour if not supported by the backend.</p>

<h3>Subclassing fd_watcher</h3>

<p>To specify callback behaviour, <i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i> can be subclassed &mdash; however, it should
not be directly subclassed; instead, use the <i class="code-name">fd_watcher_impl</i> implementation wrapper
template.</p>

<h3>Regular files</h3>

<p>In general readiness notification for regular files is not supported by event loop backends, and arguably a
file is always ready for reading and writing (although the operation may block). However in some cases it is
convenient to treat such file descriptors as if they were connected to pipes or sockets;
<i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i> by default supports emulation of readiness events for regular files,
which assumes they are always ready; this can be prevented using the "noemu" variant of the watch
registration functions.</p>

<p>Note that some backends do support regular files. In particular, kqueue supports read but not write
watches on regular files, though with slightly modified semantics: at end-of-file, the file descriptor
no longer reports as being ready-for-read. On FreeBSD, kqueue also directly supports the preferred semantics
where a file is always considered ready for reading. Portable code should not rely on any particular
semantics for the end-of-file condition if emulation is disabled.</p>

<h3>Listening sockets</h3>

<p>An <i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i> can be used to detect incoming connections on a listening socket. New
connections will be signalled as input readiness.</p>

<p>A special problem, not specific to Dasynq, can occur when the process has reached its file descriptor
limit before a new connection arrives on a listening socket. In this case, it will be impossible to accept
the new connection and it will remain pending, causing input readiness to be reported repeatedly. There are
no solutions to this problem that are satisfactory in all cases; it is an issue inherent in the POSIX API.</p> 

<h3>Closing files</h2>

<p>Any watchers for a file descriptor should be removed or disabled before closing the file descriptor. This
is due to limitations in back-ends.</p>

<p>There are two specific cases which are problematic:</p>

<ul>
<li>A file is closed, then the file descriptor is re-assigned due to opening another file descriptor. With
some back-ends this could result in the watcher being issued a callback due to the state of the new file.</li>
<li>A file descriptor is duplicated (using <i class="code-name">dup()</i> or similar) before the original
is closed. This may result in the original watcher still receiving callbacks for events on the underlying
file.
</ul>

<p>If the above situations can be avoided, it may be safe to close file descriptors before removing their
watchers. However, it is recommended to avoid this if possible.</p>


<h2 id="add_watch_2">add_watch (#2)</h2>

<pre>
// member of dasynq::event_loop&lt;T&gt;::fd_watcher
template &lt;typename T&gt;
static fd_watcher&lt;event_loop_t&gt; *add_watch(event_loop_t &eloop, int fd, int flags, T watch_hndlr)
</pre>

<p>This variant of the <i class="code-name">add_watch</i> function can be used to create and register a
dynamically-allocated <i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i>. The first three parameters are the same as for
<i class="code-name">add_watch</i>(#1). The <i class="code-name">watch_hndlr</i> parameter is a function
or lambda of the form:</p>

<pre>
[](event_loop_t &eloop, int fd, int flags) -> rearm { ... }
</pre>

<p>It acts as the callback function for the generated watcher. The watcher will delete itself when it is
removed from the event loop.</p>

<p>This function can throw <i class="code-name">std::system_error</i> or
<i class="code-name">std::bad_alloc</i> on failure.</p>

<h2 id="fd_watcher_impl">fd_watcher_impl</h2>

<p><b>Brief</b>: The <i class="code-name">fd_watcher_impl</i> provides a basis for implementing
<i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i>, using the "curiously recurring template pattern". Instead of
subclassing <i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i> directly, subclass an instantiation of
<i class="code-name">fd_watcher_impl</i> with the template parameter specified as the subclass itself.
For example:</p>

<pre>
class my_watcher : public event_loop_t::fd_watcher_impl&lt;my_watcher&gt;
{
    // ...
}
</pre>

<h2>Details and Usage</h2>

<p>The callback function must be provided in the subclass and named <i class="code-name">fd_event</i>, with
a signature compatible with the following:</p>

<pre>
rearm fd_event(event_loop_t &amp; loop, int fd, int flags);
</pre>

<p>The <i class="code-name">fd_event</i> function must be public, but need not be virtual. It will be called
with the following parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><i class="code-name">loop</i> &mdash; a reference to the event loop.</li>
<li><i class="code-name">fd</i> &mdash; the file descriptor being watched, as specified at registration.</li>
<li><i class="code-name">flags</i> &mdash; a combination of flags specifying the event type, possibly
    including <i class="code-name">dasynq::IN_EVENTS</i> or <i class="code-name">dasynq::OUT_EVENTS</i> or
    both. It may also include <i class="code-name">dasynq::ERR_EVENTS</i> if an error condition has been
    detected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Error conditions (flagged by the presence of <i class="code-name">dasynq::ERR_EVENTS</i>) include, for
example, when the file descriptor refers to a socket to which data has been written but the other end
of the connection has been closed. An error condition may not relate to the specific read or write operation
that is otherwise appropriate for the flags, however, an error condition will not be signalled without
either of <i class="code-name">dasynq::IN_EVENTS</i> or <i class="code-name">dasynq::OUT_EVENTS</i> also
being set.</p>

<p>The return value specifies the <a href="dasynq-namespace.html"><i class="code-name">rearm</i></a> action.</p>

<p>An <i class="code-name">fd_watcher_impl</i> instantiation has no public or protected members, other than
those inherited from <i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i>, which it publicly derives from.</p>
